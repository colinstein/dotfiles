# Colin's Dotfiles
I've been sort of lazy about keeping this stuff up to date. I've also started
exploring some new software and clawing back the customization that I do to
systems because it's not worth the pain of maintaining it.

For now I'm just going to toss some files in the repository and then I'll
supplement that with some documentation about the software I regularly use and
the various dependencies later.

This is probably a good time to investigate some sort of automated setup or at
least a standardized tool for this just so that it's "self documenting".
