# Colin's Dotfiles

Slow progress away from large frameworks and default configuration.
Expects:

  - neovim
  - gnu core-utils
  - alacritty
  - zsh

Then it's time for a symlink party.

  ~/.tmux
  ~/.zshenv

For now I've got some plugins required in ~/.config/zsh:

  - autosuggestions
  - syntax-highlighting
